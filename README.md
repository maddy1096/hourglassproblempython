To find the maximum sum of an hourglass in a 2d matrix using python
Given a 2D matrix, the task is that we find maximum sum of a hour glass.

An hour glass is made of 7 cells
in following form.
    A B C
      D
    E F G
    
Examples:

Input : 1 1 1 0 0 
        0 1 0 0 0 
        1 1 1 0 0 
        0 0 0 0 0 
        0 0 0 0 0 
Output : 7
Below is the hour glass with
maximum sum:
1 1 1

1 1 1
                                                      
Input : 0 3 0 0 0
        0 1 0 0 0
        1 1 1 0 0
        0 0 2 4 4
        0 0 0 2 4
Output : 11
